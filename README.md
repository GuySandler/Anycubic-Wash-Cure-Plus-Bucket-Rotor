# Anycubic-Wash-Cure-Plus-Bucket-Rotor

I know this is a short project but I am a very experienced and skilled maker.

My used wash and cure + station had rusted on magnets so I made my own since Anycubic stopped selling it.

tested with these magnets + 4 m6x16 (length doesn't matter too much) bolts + 4 m6 nuts
