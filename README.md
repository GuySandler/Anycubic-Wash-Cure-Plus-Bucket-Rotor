# Anycubic-Wash-Cure-Plus-Bucket-Rotor

I know this is a short project but I am a very experienced and skilled maker.

My used wash and cure + station had rusted on magnets so I made my own since Anycubic stopped selling it.

tested with these magnets + 4 m6x16 (length doesn't matter too much) bolts + 4 m6 nuts

Iteration 1: base too thick

Iteration 2: I forgot gravity exists and it will just fall off the bearing so I added a lip

Iteration 3: Perfection [Demo video that was too big to upload WITH LIQUID](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMsFkxQYRR8_G2sFA3TkSwcBh1i6oLq1-Y3hWvhIdDZQwFN1fCxm2NjFOAg0qx2VQ/photo/AF1QipP9N_b6RoGLtLYXV6nfdOC0uIfbE9zeJlMFOanM?key=T01OMTBFLTlLU3ZnREtKQkk5eVY5RUFWYVh1WnRB) [Demo video 2 NO LIQUID](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPUC6nQqkXk8Z0NB3I6jvT86Gvi9qHhmXq4Ch6hGsHxob0J6B17JygZNc7MEyWrtw/photo/AF1QipNS4SLQ9tZuUEEuH3xE6NJNdHVPJymXlqDgKJ7l?key=dmUzUkdIYkVUSDBzWURDb3RGcUNNQVVlbXBRYl93)
